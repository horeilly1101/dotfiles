# dotfiles
> A collection of simple dotfiles and config information for my mac.

## What it does

This repo organizes some of the basic info that I need to set up a new macbook
with my preferred configurations, and it has a script to install the included
dotfiles as symbolic links in the home directory. To run it, simply execute
`./setup.sh` in the `dotfiles` directory.

## Misc.

I like [this theme](https://draculatheme.com/iterm) for iterm and [this theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) for vscode.
