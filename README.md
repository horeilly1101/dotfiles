# dotfiles
> A collection of simple dotfiles and config information for my mac.

## What it does

This repo organizes some of the basic info that I need to set up a new macbook
with my preferred configurations. Run `setup.sh` to set up the terminal.

## Misc.

I use [this theme](https://draculatheme.com/iterm) for iterm and [this theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) for vscode. 

I use [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install) with the [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme.
